Well first of all thank you very much for the opportunity My name is Fernando LÃ³pez
To get started with the project i install larevel through artisan, create a database called dbmycandidates, did the migrations through artisan, add an authenticate module with bootstrap, create a photo field, download virtual box and vagrant and configure the laravel homestead environment, One difficulty I had was to activate the virtual machine of my computer, another difficulties that I had were the routes because I had not realized that in the web routes file, to a call to CandidatesControllers, it generated an error but I knew how to solve it very easily.
